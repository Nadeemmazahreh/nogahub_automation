    outputFile: 'equipment_database_export.xlsx',
    logFile: 'export_log.txt'
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Ensure you're using a valid admin token
   - Check token hasn't expired
   - Try getting a fresh token

2. **"No equipment data found"**
   - Verify production database connectivity
   - Check admin permissions
   - Ensure equipment exists in database

3. **"File permission errors"**
   - Check write permissions in current directory
   - Close Excel if file is currently open
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

### Getting Help:

1. **Check log file**: `export_log.txt` contains detailed error information
2. **Verify API health**: Visit `https://nogahubautomation-production.up.railway.app/api/health`
3. **Test authentication**: Ensure admin login works in the web app

## Security Notes

- **Keep tokens secure** - Don't share or commit authentication tokens
- **Tokens expire** - Get fresh token if export fails with auth errors  
- **Admin access only** - Only admin users can export equipment data
- **Production data** - Handle exported data according to company policies
